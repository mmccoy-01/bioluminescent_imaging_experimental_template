This is a template I made for making reproducable, replicable, templateable, modular, and accurate experimental documentation for studies involving bioluminescent imaging.

My goal is to neatly package all experimental aspects together to provide an exhaustive yet succinctly navigable format.

The top of the .Rmd file must be modified with respect to specific experimental parameters. Then, the .Rmd file is knitted to .html for a user-friendly report.

*raw_data.csv* and *raw_mass.csv* must be manually edited. The output .csv files from Living ImageÂ® are manually added to *data/imaging/raw/week_#/*

Here is the folder hierarchy:

- **experiment_name/**
  - *experiment_name.md*: Markdown file for all experimental documentation
  - *experiment_name.Rmd*: R Markdown file for knitting experimental documentation into HTML
  - *experiment_name.html*: HTML file for user-friendly rendering of experimental documentation

  - **data/**
    - **imaging/**
      - **processed/**
        - *week_1/*: Contains processed Living Image data for Week 1
        - *week_2/*: Contains processed Living Image data for Week 2
        - *week_1.csv*: Contains imaging data for Week 1
        - *week_2.csv*: Contains imaging data for Week 2
        - ...
      - **raw/**
        - *week_1/*: Contains unprocessed Living Image data for Week 1
        - *week_2/*: Contains unprocessed Living Image data for Week 2
        - ...

    - **cage_cards/**
      - *000001.png*
      - *000002.png*
      - ...

    - **processed/**
      - *processed_data.csv*: Contains all experimental data
      - *mouse_current_data.csv*: Contains currently relevant mouse data for tracking

    - **raw/**
      - *raw_data.csv*: Contains all experimental data except imaging_data.csv
      - *raw_mass.csv*: Contains mass of all mice
